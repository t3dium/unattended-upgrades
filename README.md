# unattended-upgrades
Because 3000 lines of python in order to update your system, has to be the dumbest thing i've ever heard

Unattended upgrades is extremely bloated for what it's meant to do, it's written in python as well, since doing an upgrade took several hours on a weak machine I decided to make a **1** line bash script, to automatically upgrade debian based linux systems periodically.
