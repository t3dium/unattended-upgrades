# unattended-upgrades
A single line bash script to replace the official dumb unattended-upgrades script.

Unattended upgrades is extremely bloated for what it's meant to do, it's written in python as well, since doing an upgrade took several hours on a weak machine I decided to make a **1** line bash script, to automatically upgrade debian based linux systems periodically.
